# TicTacToe

## Todo
- ~~Replace circle with white pawn in SVG format~~
- ~~Replace cross with black pawn in SVG format~~
- ~~Extend the board (and also the rule) to 5x5~~
- ~~If you could, please make the board resizeable~~
- If this was a professional project, how would you test your solutions? - Using the react-test-renderer or the React Native Testing Library, I'd focus on a few behavirout such as:
  - Renders the correct number of spaces
  - Renders the spaces with correct size and color
  - Toggles user turn and player's turn correctly 
  - etc
